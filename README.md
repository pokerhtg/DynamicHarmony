Old World Mod

Codebase for Old World mod, released as Dynamic Battlefield.
"
Strategic war mod focus on unique movement patterns, morale, and role-based combat.
Companion Mod: Dynamic World, Dynamic Units, Middle Kingdom Map.

This is an ongoing project, still in its infancy; meaning while each feature below is mature, the total number features will grow over time

Key features:
Retreating: new unit mechanic where skirmisher units will retreat when attacked in melee range.
Friendly fire: AoE damage (e.g. Pierce, Splash) will now affect all units caught in the crossfire, including friendly and neutral ones


Thanks for playing my mod, you can find me on the Old World Discord as ```Harry!```.
